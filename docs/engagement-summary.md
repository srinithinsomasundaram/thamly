# User Engagement Summary (Thamly)

Stage | Goal | Engagement Tool
--- | --- | ---
Day 0–1 | First success fast | Demo + transliteration + instant fixes (welcome draft, pause nudge, quick fixes)
Day 2–3 | Curiosity | Tone suggestions + News mode prompts
Day 4–5 | Habit loop | Progress dashboard + streak banner/rewards
Day 6–7 | Conversion | Trial expiry nudges + soft-upgrade messages
Post-trial | Retention | Limited free but useful → gentle Pro upsell

Notes:
- Trial: treated as Pro for features/limits; day-based banners in editor (1/3/5/7).
- Streaks: local tracking with rewards at days 3/5/10 to encourage repeat writing.
- Soft gates: near-limit banner, News mode nudge, no hard blocks.
